        \begin{highlights}
            \item Working on upgrading “The Explorer” submarine to ROV by addressing corrosion issues and implementing design changes, ensuring progress towards the Summer 2025 deadline
            %\item Generated a bill of materials for the submarine upgrade, sourcing trusted vendors and ensuring stakeholder requirements were met, resulting in a cost-effective and accurate budget proposal.
            \item Tasked with improving deep-sea exploration capabilities, I constructed, modified, and operated a BlueROV 2 kit with high-precision sonar, enabling successful dives and data collection at depths of up to 500 meters
            \item Developed VBA macros in Excel to automate weekly schedule tracking and calculations, streamlining processes by interpreting color-coded cells, saving time, and reducing errors in project management
            \item Office of Naval Research (ONR) FOA N00014-21-S-F004 Science, Technology, Engineering \& Mathematics (STEM), Education and Workforce Program, “Exploring Naval Underwater STEM (Exploring NUSTEM)”

    \begin{onecolentry}
        \begin{highlights}
            \item Accomplished successful data collection during the Annular and Total solar eclipses by leading a team of 10 engineers to design payload systems that withstood 100+ MPH winds and altitudes over 100,000 feet
            \item Accomplished real-time flight tracking and internet broadcasts by developing a telemetry GUI to track GPS and video signals from high-altitude balloons, resulting in live footage capture across 33 miles
            \item Ensured successful completion of project milestones by supervising several teams of students and faculty across the East Central Region, resolving hardware and software issues, resulting in efficient project execution
            \item Improved team communication and project progress by organising weekly meetings and collaborating with the Principal Investigator, resulting in milestones being met on time
            \item National Aeronautics And Space Administration, Subaward Title: Montana Space Grant Consortium Opportunities in STEM 2020-2024, Subaward ID: G355-22-W9649
